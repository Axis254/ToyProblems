Overview

This repository contains HTML and JavaScript solutions to three toy problems: a student grade generator, a speed detector, and a net salary calculator. These problems are designed to practice basic web development concepts, including DOM manipulation, input handling, and basic arithmetic operations.

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
This solution prompts the user to input student marks (0-100) and outputs the corresponding grade based on the marks.

Grades:

A: > 79
B: 60 to 79
C: 49 to 59
D: 40 to 49
E: Less than 40

Challenge 2: Speed Detector
This solution takes the speed of a car as input and prints "Ok" if the speed is less than 70. For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point. If the driver gets more than 12 points, it prints "License suspended."

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
This solution calculates an individualâ€™s net salary by taking the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates the payee (Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary using provided KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values.

Deductions:

PAYE (Tax): Calculated based on progressive tax rates.
NHIF: Deductions based on gross salary brackets.
NSSF: 6% of gross salary up to a maximum of 1800.
